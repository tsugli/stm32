This is the perl script 'makefsdata' converted to a plain C console application
and extended a bit.

Usage: htmlgen [targetdir] [-s] [-i]s
   targetdir: relative or absolute path to files to convert
   switch -s: toggle processing of subdirectories (default is on)
   switch -e: exclude HTTP header from file (header is created at runtime, default is on)
   switch -11: include HTTP 1.1 header (1.0 is default)

  if targetdir not specified, htmlgen will attempt to
  process files in subdirectory 'fs'.
